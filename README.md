# 🐼 Bestie AI Hub — Mobile Multi-Model Orchestration

**What this is:**  
A lightweight AI control hub I built entirely on **Android (Motorola G-series) using Termux + Hugging Face + multiple AI APIs**.  
It orchestrates **multiple AI models talking to each other** (Claude / DeepSeek / OpenAI / Qwen / Grok / Kimi / Minstrel), enabling **draft → critique → final polish → optional memory**, all from a **phone**, not a laptop.

## 🚀 Why this project is unique
- Runs **100% on mobile** — no laptop, no cloud VM
- Uses **real paid AI APIs** (not just chat apps)
- Handles **multi-model orchestration & fallbacks**
- Future-ready for **OSINT, content pipelines, Seemless dating AI**, and more
- Moves me from **“AI user” → “AI systems builder”**
