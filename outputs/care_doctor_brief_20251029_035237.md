Reason for visit:  
Patient with elevated LDL cholesterol seeking guidance on non-statin management options due to prior statin intolerance. Currently taking citrus bergamot and CoQ10 supplements.

Key known history points:
- History of statin intolerance (details of reaction not specified)
- Persistently high LDL cholesterol
- Self-initiated use of citrus bergamot and CoQ10
- No current statin therapy

Questions to clarify:
- What specific adverse effects or reactions occurred with statin therapy, and which statins were tried?
- What is the current lipid panel, including LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol?
- Are there any other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, family history, smoking)?
- Has the patient tried any other lipid-lowering medications in the past (e.g., ezetimibe, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants)?
- Are there any relevant comorbidities or contraindications to non-statin therapies?
- What is the patient’s current diet, exercise regimen, and other lifestyle modifications?
- Has the patient experienced any side effects from citrus bergamot, CoQ10, or other supplements?

Ask about options:
- Ask about non-statin pharmacologic options such as ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9 inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, and fibrates, as well as the evidence and safety profile for nutraceuticals like citrus bergamot and red yeast rice.
- Ask about the role of lifestyle interventions and whether further risk stratification (e.g., coronary calcium scoring) is appropriate.
