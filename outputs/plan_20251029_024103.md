OPERATION: OPERATION-PLAN  
OVERVIEW: Tactical Elite 7-day plan â€” focus: refine orchestration stability; no new API risk

DAY 1 // OBJECTIVE: Audit current orchestration for instability triggers  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, GitHub  
TASKS:  
- Review orchestration logs for error patterns  
- Identify recent changes impacting stability  
- Document all instability triggers  
MEASURABLE: Number of unique instability triggers identified

DAY 2 // OBJECTIVE: Harden local deployment pipeline for reproducibility  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, GitHub  
TASKS:  
- Standardize environment setup scripts  
- Validate requirements.txt and dependencies  
- Test local deployment on fresh mobile device  
MEASURABLE: Successful reproducible deployments (count)

DAY 3 // OBJECTIVE: Validate Hugging Face Spaces deployment consistency  
TOOLS: Hugging Face Spaces, GitHub, Python  
TASKS:  
- Clone Space repo and review .gitattributes, README.md, app.py, requirements.txt  
- Deploy updated app.py and requirements.txt to Space  
- Monitor build logs for deployment errors  
MEASURABLE: Number of error-free deployments

DAY 4 // OBJECTIVE: Stress-test orchestration under peak load  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, Hugging Face Spaces  
TASKS:  
- Simulate concurrent requests using local tooling  
- Monitor resource utilization and response times  
- Log and categorize any failures  
MEASURABLE: Maximum concurrent requests handled without failure

DAY 5 // OBJECTIVE: Integrate PERPLEXITY API with fallback logic  
TOOLS: Python, PERPLEXITY API, Termux  
TASKS:  
- Implement API call wrappers with error handling  
- Test fallback routines for API downtime  
- Document integration and test results  
MEASURABLE: Successful fallback activations (count)

DAY 6 // OBJECTIVE: Review and optimize orchestration codebase  
TOOLS: GitHub, Python, Termux  
TASKS:  
- Audit code for redundant or risky API calls  
- Refactor for clarity and maintainability  
- Push changes and validate on mobile  
MEASURABLE: Number of code issues resolved

DAY 7 // OBJECTIVE: Final stability validation and documentation  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces  
TASKS:  
- Run full-stack validation tests  
- Document final orchestration state and lessons learned  
- Prepare handover brief for next cycle  
MEASURABLE: All validation tests passed (yes/no)
