<h2 id="doctor-brief">Doctor Brief</h2>
<p>Reason for visit:<br />
Patient with elevated LDL cholesterol seeking guidance on non-statin
management options due to prior statin intolerance. Currently taking
citrus bergamot and CoQ10 supplements.</p>
<p>Key known history points: - History of statin intolerance (details of
reaction not specified) - Persistently high LDL cholesterol -
Self-initiated use of citrus bergamot and CoQ10 - No current statin
therapy</p>
<p>Questions to clarify: - What specific adverse effects or reactions
occurred with statin therapy, and which statins were tried? - What is
the current lipid panel, including LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total
cholesterol? - Are there any other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g.,
diabetes, hypertension, family history, smoking)? - Has the patient
tried any other lipid-lowering medications in the past (e.g., ezetimibe,
fibrates, bile acid sequestrants)? - Are there any relevant
comorbidities or contraindications to non-statin therapies? - What is
the patient’s current diet, exercise regimen, and other lifestyle
modifications? - Has the patient experienced any side effects from
citrus bergamot, CoQ10, or other supplements?</p>
<p>Ask about options: - Ask about non-statin pharmacologic options such
as ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9 inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants,
and fibrates, as well as the evidence and safety profile for
nutraceuticals like citrus bergamot and red yeast rice. - Ask about the
role of lifestyle interventions and whether further risk stratification
(e.g., coronary calcium scoring) is appropriate.</p>
