OPERATION: OPERATION-PLAN  
OVERVIEW: Tactical Elite 7-day plan â€” focus: refine orchestration stability; no new API risk

DAY 1 // OBJECTIVE: Audit current orchestration for instability vectors.  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, GitHub  
TASKS:
- Inventory all orchestration scripts and dependencies.
- Identify recent failures or instability events.
- Document all third-party API touchpoints.
MEASURABLE: Number of instability vectors logged.

DAY 2 // OBJECTIVE: Harden local execution environments for reproducibility.  
TOOLS: Termux, Python, requirements.txt  
TASKS:
- Standardize Python environments using virtualenv.
- Pin all package versions in requirements.txt.
- Validate local runs of all orchestration scripts.
MEASURABLE: Percentage of scripts reproducibly executed locally.

DAY 3 // OBJECTIVE: Validate Hugging Face Spaces deployment pipeline (no new APIs).  
TOOLS: Hugging Face Spaces, GitHub, Python  
TASKS:
- Review and update app.py and requirements.txt for Spaces.
- Test local deployment using the same dependencies as Spaces.
- Push to GitHub and trigger Hugging Face Space build.
MEASURABLE: Successful Space build and local parity.

DAY 4 // OBJECTIVE: Stress-test orchestration under mobile constraints.  
TOOLS: Termux, Hugging Face Spaces (mobile), Python  
TASKS:
- Simulate mobile resource limits in Termux.
- Run full orchestration and log performance bottlenecks.
- Adjust scripts for mobile compatibility.
MEASURABLE: Number of successful mobile orchestration runs.

DAY 5 // OBJECTIVE: Integrate lightweight local monitoring for stability.  
TOOLS: Python, local logging tools, GitHub  
TASKS:
- Implement logging for key orchestration steps.
- Store logs locally and sync with GitHub as needed.
- Review logs for silent failures or edge-case errors.
MEASURABLE: Number of actionable issues detected via logs.

DAY 6 // OBJECTIVE: Conduct controlled rollback and recovery drills.  
TOOLS: GitHub, Python, Termux  
TASKS:
- Simulate failure scenarios and execute rollback procedures.
- Validate recovery scripts and data integrity.
- Document recovery times and gaps.
MEASURABLE: Mean time to recovery (MTTR) for orchestrated tasks.

DAY 7 // OBJECTIVE: Final stability review and documentation handoff.  
TOOLS: GitHub, Markdown, Python  
TASKS:
- Review all changes and stability metrics.
- Update orchestration documentation for current state.
- Brief team on findings and next steps.
MEASURABLE: Documentation completeness score.
