Here is a list of respectful, concise follow-up questions a prepared patient could ask to better understand their health and care plan:

- What is my current diagnosis, and can you explain what it means for my health?
- What are the main goals of my treatment or follow-up plan?
- Are there any new test results or changes in my condition I should know about?
- What symptoms or side effects should I watch for and report?
- How will I know if my treatment is working or if something needs to change?
- Are there alternative options for my treatment or care?
- What are the possible risks or benefits of my current plan?
- How will my medicines, tests, or procedures affect my daily life?
- Who should I contact if I have questions or problems between visits?
- When should I schedule my next appointment or follow-up?
