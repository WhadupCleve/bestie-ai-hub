# Care Council — Vision (Family-First AI)
Goal: 10 specialized AI roles work together to prepare a clinician-ready brief with citations and a plain-language patient summary. This supports medical conversations; it does not diagnose or prescribe.

Principles:
- Support, not replace clinicians. Privacy-first, consent-logged, with receipts.
- Every claim linked to a credible source or marked “judgment; verify.”

Minimal Output (every time):
1) Doctor Brief (neutral, structured, with citations)
2) Patient Summary (plain English)
3) Appendix (sources, trace, guardrails applied)
